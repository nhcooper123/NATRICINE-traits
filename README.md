## Data


------
## Analyses
All code used to run analyses and make figures is included in the `analyses/` folder. Before starting remember to open an RStudio project from that folder.

### Running the analyses 
The main analyses are in the following scripts within the `analyses/` folder.

1. *XXXX.R*. 

-------
## Other folders

* `/outputs` contains the figures and tables.


------
## Session Info
For reproducibility purposes, here is the output of `devtools:session_info()` used to perform the analyses in the publication.

## Checkpoint for reproducibility
To rerun all the code with packages as they existed on CRAN at time of our analyses we recommend using the `checkpoint` package, and running this code prior to the analysis:

```{r}
checkpoint("2021-XX-XX") 
```
